/*
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

O linked list of reversed sum of given lists
I two linked lists
C none
E none

basic idea: keep track of remainder, carry over to next node value
